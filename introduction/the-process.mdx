# The Context Engineering Process

Context engineering in XOOS follows a structured, repeatable process. This page explains each phase in detail.

## Process Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. GATHER  →  2. STRUCTURE  →  3. MAP  →  4. WRITE  →  5. MAINTAIN  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Phase 1: Knowledge Gathering

**Goal**: Collect all source materials in one centralized repository.

### What to Gather

- Training documents and manuals
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Policy documents
- Email templates and macros
- FAQ documents
- Reference materials
- Tribal knowledge (document it!)

### Key Point

<Warning>
The knowledge you gather is **raw material**. It is NOT directly used by AI agents. Think of it as ingredients—you'll process them in later phases.
</Warning>

### How to Do It

1. Work with the client or team to identify all relevant materials
2. Upload everything to the Knowledge section
3. Categorize by type (SOP, Policy, Template, etc.)
4. Don't worry about perfection—completeness matters more

## Phase 2: Define Hierarchy

**Goal**: Create a clear structure that organizes your domain.

### The Three Levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Workstream** | Broad operational area | "Customer Support Chat" |
| **Contact Driver** | Category of inquiry | "Order Issues" |
| **Scenario** | Specific situation | "Cancel Order" |

### Decision: Mimic or Create?

You have two approaches:

1. **Mimic the client's setup**: If the client already has categories, queues, or structures, mirror them in XOOS
2. **Create from scratch**: Design an optimal structure based on the knowledge gathered

Either works—the goal is a clear, logical breakdown.

### Why Structure Matters

A good hierarchy:
- Enables AI to quickly find the right guidance
- Makes maintenance manageable
- Scales without becoming chaotic
- Reduces confusion and overlap

## Phase 3: Map Knowledge

**Goal**: Link raw materials to the scenarios where they're relevant.

### Why Mapping?

Mapping creates the connection between your source materials and your scenarios. It answers: "What knowledge do we need to write this scenario's step guide?"

### How to Map

For each scenario:
1. Identify which knowledge documents are relevant
2. Link them to the scenario
3. This creates your reference set for writing

### Benefits

- Know exactly what sources to use per scenario
- Track knowledge coverage (are all docs mapped?)
- Future AI assistance can use mappings to auto-generate guides

## Phase 4: Write Step Guides

**Goal**: Create one AI-ready step guide per scenario.

### What Makes a Step Guide?

Step guides are **the finished product** of context engineering:

- Structured, step-by-step instructions
- Written for AI consumption
- Clear decision points and branches
- Consistent formatting

### One Guide Per Scenario

Each scenario gets exactly one step guide. This 1:1 relationship ensures:
- No ambiguity about which guide applies
- Easy updates and versioning
- Clear accountability

### Currently Manual

Today, writing step guides is a manual process. You reference the mapped knowledge and write clear procedures.

<Note>
Future versions of XOOS will offer AI-assisted guide writing based on your mapped knowledge.
</Note>

## Phase 5: Maintain

**Goal**: Keep your context current through versioning.

### Versioning

Step guides support version control:
- Create new versions when processes change
- Add version comments explaining changes
- Historical versions are preserved

### Ongoing Process

Context engineering isn't one-and-done. As processes change:
1. Update the relevant step guides
2. Create new versions with clear notes
3. AI agents automatically use the current version

## The Full Picture

When you complete this process, you have:

```
Knowledge Section
├── All raw materials collected and categorized
│
Hierarchy
├── Workstream: Customer Support
│   ├── Contact Driver: Order Issues
│   │   ├── Scenario: Cancel Order → Step Guide v2
│   │   ├── Scenario: Modify Order → Step Guide v1
│   │   └── Scenario: Track Order → Step Guide v3
│   │
│   └── Contact Driver: Returns
│       ├── Scenario: Start Return → Step Guide v1
│       └── Scenario: Check Status → Step Guide v1
```

AI agents can now navigate this structure and use the appropriate step guide for any situation.
