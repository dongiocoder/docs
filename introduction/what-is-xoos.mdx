# What is XOOS?

XOOS (XtendOps Operating System) is a platform that enables non-technical teams to do **context engineering**—the practice of organizing knowledge so AI agents can use it effectively.

## The Problem XOOS Solves

Organizations have vast amounts of knowledge: training manuals, process documents, policies, templates, and tribal knowledge spread across systems and people's heads. This knowledge is valuable, but it's not in a format that AI can reliably use.

When you give an AI agent raw documents:
- It may miss important context
- It can't follow your specific processes
- Responses are inconsistent
- There's no structure to maintain or improve

## The XOOS Approach

XOOS provides a structured framework to transform raw knowledge into AI-ready context:

```
Raw Materials → Structured Hierarchy → AI-Ready Step Guides
```

### Not Just for Customer Support

While many context engineering projects start with customer support, XOOS works for any domain where you need AI to follow your processes:

- **Sales**: Product knowledge, objection handling, pricing rules
- **HR**: Policy questions, onboarding procedures, benefits information
- **Operations**: Process documentation, troubleshooting guides
- **IT Support**: Technical procedures, system documentation
- **Legal/Compliance**: Policy interpretation, procedure guidance

## Key Concepts

### Knowledge vs. Step Guides

This is the most important distinction in XOOS:

| Knowledge | Step Guides |
|-----------|-------------|
| Raw source materials | Processed, AI-ready content |
| Input to the process | Output of the process |
| What you collect | What AI agents use |
| PDFs, docs, templates | Structured procedures |

**Knowledge** is what you gather—the raw ingredients.
**Step Guides** are what AI agents actually use—the finished product.

### The Hierarchy

XOOS organizes your domain into three levels:

1. **Workstreams**: High-level areas (e.g., "Customer Support", "Sales Inquiries")
2. **Contact Drivers**: Categories within each workstream (e.g., "Order Issues", "Returns")
3. **Scenarios**: Specific situations (e.g., "Cancel Order", "Request Refund")

This hierarchy creates clarity and enables AI to quickly find the right guidance.

## Who Uses XOOS?

XOOS is designed for non-technical teams:

- **Operations teams** defining processes
- **Subject matter experts** documenting knowledge
- **Team leads** standardizing procedures
- **Trainers** creating reference materials

No coding required. If you can write a document, you can do context engineering.
