# Quickstart

This guide walks you through the essential steps to start context engineering with XOOS.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a XOOS account
- A set of source documents (training materials, procedures, etc.)

## Step 1: Upload Your Knowledge

Start by collecting your raw materials in the Knowledge section.

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** in the sidebar
2. Click **Upload** or **Create Document**
3. Add your training documents, SOPs, templates, and reference materials
4. Categorize each document (Support Article, SOP, Policy, Template)

<Tip>
Don't worry about formatting at this stage. The goal is to get everything into one place. You'll process it later.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create Your First Workstream

Workstreams are your top-level categories.

1. Go to **Context Engineering** > **Workstreams**
2. Click **Create Workstream**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Customer Support Chat")
4. Select the type (Inbound, Outbound, or Background)
5. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Add Contact Drivers

Contact drivers represent the main reasons someone would reach out.

1. Open your workstream
2. Click **Add Contact Driver**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Order Issues")
4. Add a description explaining what this covers
5. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Define Scenarios

Scenarios are specific situations within each contact driver.

1. Open a contact driver
2. Click **Add Scenario**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Cancel Order")
4. Add a description
5. Click **Save**

## Step 5: Link Knowledge to Scenarios

Map your raw materials to the scenarios where they're relevant.

1. Open a scenario
2. Click **Link Knowledge**
3. Select the relevant documents
4. Click **Add**

## Step 6: Create a Step Guide

Now create the AI-ready content for each scenario.

1. Go to **Knowledge** > **Step Guides**
2. Click **Create Step Guide**
3. Reference your linked knowledge documents
4. Write step-by-step instructions
5. Click **Save**

## Step 7: Connect to the Scenario

Link your step guide to its scenario.

1. Open the scenario
2. Click **Link Step Guide**
3. Select your guide
4. Click **Confirm**

## You're Ready!

Your first scenario is now fully context-engineered:
- Raw knowledge collected
- Hierarchy defined
- Knowledge mapped
- Step guide written

Repeat this process for each scenario in your domain.
