# File Uploads

In addition to creating documents with the editor, you can upload existing files to the knowledge base.

## Supported File Types

Currently supported:

| Format | Extension | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PDF | .pdf | Policies, manuals, forms |

<Note>
Additional file formats may be supported in future updates. Contact your administrator for the current list.
</Note>

## Uploading a File

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Documents**
2. Click **Upload File** (or **Create Document** > **Upload**)
3. Select your file or drag and drop
4. Fill in the metadata:
   - Title
   - Category
   - Visibility
   - Tags
5. Click **Upload**

## File Metadata

When uploading, provide:

### Title

A descriptive title for the document.

**Example:** "Employee Handbook 2024" not "handbook.pdf"

### Category

Same categories as editor-created documents:
- Support Article
- SOP
- Policy
- Template
- Other

### Visibility

- **Internal** - Only for agents
- **Public** - Can be shared with customers

### Tags

Keywords for organization and search.

## Viewing Uploaded Files

Uploaded files display in the documents list alongside editor-created documents. They show:

- File icon indicating type (PDF)
- Title and category
- File size
- Upload date

Click to preview the file in the browser (if supported) or download.

## File Details

Each uploaded file tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| File Name | Original filename |
| File Type | MIME type |
| File Size | Size in bytes/KB/MB |
| Uploaded By | User who uploaded |
| Upload Date | When uploaded |

## Replacing Files

To update a file with a new version:

1. Open the document
2. Click **Replace File**
3. Select the new file
4. Confirm

<Warning>
Replacing a file is permanent. The previous version is not retained. Consider keeping a local backup of important documents.
</Warning>

## Using Uploaded Files

Uploaded files work the same as editor documents:

- Can be linked to sub-scenarios
- Appear in search results
- Accessible to AI agents

However, AI agents may have limited ability to extract content from files compared to editor-created documents, depending on the file format and content structure.

## Best Practices

### When to Upload vs. Create

**Upload when:**
- You have existing documentation
- The document includes complex formatting
- The original format must be preserved
- The document is a form or printable

**Create in editor when:**
- Starting from scratch
- Content is primarily text
- Frequent updates expected
- Search and extraction are important

### File Organization

- Use clear, consistent naming
- Apply appropriate categories
- Add descriptive tags
- Keep file sizes reasonable

### Accessibility

For uploaded PDFs:
- Ensure text is selectable (not scanned images)
- Use OCR for scanned documents
- Include alt text for images in source document

## Deleting Uploaded Files

Same process as editor documents:

1. Open the document
2. Click dropdown menu
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm

Deleting removes both the metadata and the stored file.
