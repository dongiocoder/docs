# Categorizing Knowledge

Good categorization makes your knowledge findable and helps you track coverage during the context engineering process.

## Document Categories

Every knowledge document should have a category:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Support Article** | Customer-facing help content | FAQ pages, help center articles |
| **SOP** | Internal procedures | Process docs, how-to guides |
| **Policy** | Official rules and guidelines | Return policy, refund rules |
| **Template** | Pre-written content | Email templates, chat macros |
| **Other** | Anything else | Reference docs, notes |

## Using Tags

Tags add another layer of organization:

### By Topic
- `orders`, `shipping`, `billing`, `account`

### By Product
- `product-a`, `product-b`, `premium-tier`

### By Status
- `needs-review`, `outdated`, `verified`

### By Source
- `from-training`, `from-wiki`, `tribal-knowledge`

## Visibility Settings

Control who can see each document:

- **Internal**: For agents and internal processes only
- **Public**: Can be shared with customers

Most knowledge documents should be **Internal**—they're source material for building Step Guides, not customer-facing content.

## Organizing for the Process

Think about how you'll use these documents later:

### Map to Your Hierarchy

As you categorize, consider:
- Which workstream does this relate to?
- Which contact drivers might use this?
- Which scenarios will reference this?

You don't need to assign these yet, but thinking ahead helps.

### Track Coverage

Use tags to track:
- `mapped` - Linked to at least one scenario
- `unmapped` - Not yet linked anywhere
- `needs-guide` - Referenced but no step guide written

## Best Practices

### Consistent Naming

Use a naming convention:

```
[Type] - [Topic] - [Specifics]

Good:
- "SOP - Returns - Damaged Items Process"
- "Template - Email - Refund Confirmation"

Bad:
- "returns doc"
- "Copy of training (2)"
```

### Avoid Over-Categorizing

Keep it simple:
- 5 categories is enough
- 10-15 tags per project
- More granularity isn't always better

### Document Your System

Create a quick reference for your team:

```
CATEGORIZATION GUIDE

Categories:
- Support Article: Public-facing help content
- SOP: Internal step-by-step processes
- Policy: Rules, limits, exceptions
- Template: Copy-paste responses
- Other: Reference material

Tags:
- Topic: orders, returns, billing, account
- Status: verified, needs-review
- Coverage: mapped, unmapped
```

## Next Steps

With knowledge collected and categorized:
1. [Define Your Hierarchy](/hierarchy/index) - Create structure
2. [Map Knowledge to Scenarios](/mapping/index) - Connect the dots
