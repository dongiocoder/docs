# Knowledge Gathering

The Knowledge section is your **centralized repository** for all source materials. This is the first phase of context engineering—collecting everything you need to build AI-ready content.

## Understanding the Purpose

<Warning>
**Critical distinction**: Knowledge documents are **raw materials**, not AI-ready content. They will NOT be used directly by AI agents. You'll process this material into Step Guides in later phases.
</Warning>

Think of it like cooking:
- **Knowledge** = Your ingredients (flour, eggs, sugar)
- **Step Guides** = The finished dish

You need good ingredients to make a good dish, but you don't serve raw flour.

## What to Collect

Gather everything that contains relevant information:

### Training Materials
- Onboarding documents
- Training manuals
- Process walkthroughs
- How-to guides

### Procedures & Policies
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Policy documents
- Compliance guidelines
- Rules and exceptions

### Templates & Macros
- Email templates
- Chat macros
- Response scripts
- Form letters

### Reference Content
- FAQ documents
- Product information
- System documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

### Tribal Knowledge
- Undocumented processes
- Expert tips and tricks
- Common workarounds
- Known issues

<Tip>
Don't skip tribal knowledge! Often the most valuable information isn't written down. Interview your experts and document what they know.
</Tip>

## The Collection Process

### Step 1: Identify Sources

Work with stakeholders to inventory all knowledge sources:
- Shared drives and folders
- Wiki pages
- Ticketing system macros
- Training platforms
- Team members' personal notes

### Step 2: Gather Everything

Upload all relevant materials to XOOS:
- Use **Upload** for existing files (PDFs, documents)
- Use **Create Document** for content you type or paste

### Step 3: Categorize

Assign a category to each document:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| Support Article | Customer-facing help content |
| SOP | Internal procedures |
| Policy | Official guidelines and rules |
| Template | Pre-written responses |
| Other | Anything else |

### Step 4: Review for Completeness

Before moving to the next phase, verify:
- All teams have contributed their materials
- No major topic areas are missing
- Tribal knowledge has been documented

## Quality Over Perfection

At this stage, **completeness beats perfection**:

- Don't rewrite documents before uploading
- Don't worry about formatting
- Don't skip materials because they're "rough"

You'll refine and structure the content when writing Step Guides. For now, just get it all in one place.

## Next Steps

Once your knowledge is collected:
1. [Collecting Knowledge](/knowledge/collecting) - Detailed upload instructions
2. [Categorizing Knowledge](/knowledge/categorizing) - Organizing effectively
3. [Define Your Hierarchy](/hierarchy/index) - Structure your domain
