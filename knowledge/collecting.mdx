# Collecting Knowledge

This guide covers the practical steps for getting your source materials into XOOS.

## Two Ways to Add Knowledge

### 1. Upload Existing Files

For documents that already exist as files:

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Documents**
2. Click **Upload**
3. Select your file or drag and drop
4. Fill in the metadata:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive name
   - **Category**: Type of document
   - **Visibility**: Internal or Public
   - **Tags**: Keywords for organization
5. Click **Save**

**Supported formats**: PDF (more formats coming soon)

### 2. Create New Documents

For content you want to write or paste:

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Documents**
2. Click **Create Document**
3. Enter a title
4. Use the editor to add content
5. Assign category, visibility, and tags
6. Click **Save**

## Working with Clients

When collecting knowledge from a client:

### Before the Engagement

Send a knowledge request checklist:

```
We need copies of:
□ Training materials and onboarding docs
□ SOPs and process documents
□ Policy documents
□ Email/chat templates and macros
□ FAQ documents
□ Product documentation
□ Any other reference materials agents use
```

### During Collection

1. **Set up a shared folder** for file transfers
2. **Schedule knowledge transfer sessions** with SMEs
3. **Document tribal knowledge** through interviews

### Common Sources to Check

- Ticketing system macros/templates
- Internal wikis
- Shared drives (Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox)
- Training platforms (LMS content)
- Email template libraries
- Chat macro libraries

## Organizing as You Go

While collecting, establish a naming convention:

```
[Category] - [Topic] - [Specifics]

Examples:
SOP - Returns - Damaged Items
Template - Email - Refund Confirmation
Policy - Shipping - International
```

This makes categorization easier later.

## What to Do with Poor Quality Documents

You'll encounter documents that are:
- Outdated
- Incomplete
- Poorly formatted
- Contradictory

**Still upload them.** You'll sort this out when writing Step Guides. Having everything in one place helps you identify gaps and conflicts.

Add a note in the tags or description:
- `needs-review`
- `possibly-outdated`
- `conflicts-with-[other-doc]`

## Verifying Completeness

Before moving on, check:

<Accordion title="Completeness Checklist">
- [ ] All teams/departments have contributed
- [ ] Training materials are included
- [ ] Current SOPs are uploaded
- [ ] All active templates/macros are captured
- [ ] Policy documents are present
- [ ] Known tribal knowledge is documented
- [ ] Edge cases and exceptions are noted
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

With knowledge collected:
1. [Categorize your documents](/knowledge/categorizing)
2. [Define your hierarchy](/hierarchy/index)
