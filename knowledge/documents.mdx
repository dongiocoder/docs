# Creating Documents

This guide covers creating knowledge documents using the XOOS editor.

## Creating a New Document

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Documents**
2. Click **Create Document**
3. Fill in the metadata
4. Write your content
5. Click **Save**

## Document Metadata

### Title

A clear, descriptive title for the document.

**Best practices:**
- Be specific: "30-Day Return Policy" not "Returns"
- Use searchable terms
- Keep it concise but informative

### Slug

URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated from title, can be customized).

### Category

Select the document type:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| Support Article | Customer-facing help content |
| SOP | Internal procedures |
| Policy | Official guidelines |
| Template | Pre-written responses |
| Other | Everything else |

### Visibility

- **Internal** - For agents only
- **Public** - Can be shared with customers

### Tags

Add keywords for organization and search:

```
Examples: "returns", "billing", "premium-tier", "urgent"
```

## Writing Content

The document editor supports rich text formatting:

### Text Formatting

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Links

### Structured Content

- Tables for data
- Blockquotes for important callouts
- Code blocks for technical content
- Horizontal rules for sections

### Best Practices

**Clear structure:**
```markdown
# Policy Title

## Overview
Brief summary of what this policy covers.

## Details
### When This Applies

```

**Scannable content:**
- Use headings to break up sections
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key terms
- Keep paragraphs short

**Accurate information:**
- Verify facts before publishing
- Include effective dates for policies
- Note any regional variations
- Update when information changes

## Editing Documents

1. Find the document in the list
2. Click to open
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make changes
5. Click **Save**

## Document Status

Documents don't have a draft/published workflow—they're immediately available once saved. To control visibility:

- Use the **Visibility** setting (Internal/Public)
- Don't link unfinished documents to sub-scenarios

## Deleting Documents

<Warning>
Deleting a document removes it permanently and breaks any links to sub-scenarios.
</Warning>

To delete:
1. Open the document
2. Click the dropdown menu
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the action

## Version History

Currently, documents don't maintain version history. For versioned content, consider using [Step Guides](/step-guides/index) which support full version tracking.

<Tip>
For critical policy documents that need version control, create them as step guides instead. Step guides support versioning with change comments.
