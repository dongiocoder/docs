# Welcome to XOOS

XOOS (XtendOps Operating System) enables non-technical teams to build AI agents by transforming raw knowledge into structured, AI-ready context.

Whether you're building agents for customer support, sales, HR, or any other domain, XOOS provides the framework to organize your knowledge so AI can use it effectively.

## The Context Engineering Process

Building an AI agent with XOOS follows a clear, step-by-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Knowledge" icon="database">
    Collect all your source materials: training documents, macros, templates, SOPs, and reference content. This is your raw material repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Hierarchy" icon="git-branch">
    Structure your domain into Workstreams, Contact Drivers, and Scenarios. This three-level hierarchy enables AI to navigate from broad to specific.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Knowledge" icon="link">
    Link your raw materials to the scenarios where they're relevant. This creates the connections that inform Step Guide writing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Step Guides" icon="file-text">
    Create AI-ready procedural guides for each scenario. This is the finished product your AI agents will use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Context Engineering?

AI agents are only as good as the knowledge they have access to. Raw documents, scattered PDFs, and unstructured content don't work well for AI. Context engineering transforms your existing knowledge into a format that AI agents can reliably use.

<Note>
**The result**: AI agents that give accurate, consistent responses based on your actual processes and policies.
