# Welcome to XOOS

XOOS (XtendOps Operating System) enables non-technical teams to build AI agents by transforming raw knowledge into structured, AI-ready context.

Whether you're building agents for customer support, sales, HR, or any other domain, XOOS provides the framework to organize your knowledge so AI can use it effectively.

## The Context Engineering Process

Building an AI agent with XOOS follows a clear, step-by-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Knowledge">
    Collect all your source materials: training documents, macros, templates, SOPs, and reference content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Hierarchy">
    Structure your knowledge into Workstreams, Contact Drivers, and Scenarios.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Knowledge">
    Link your raw materials to the scenarios where they're relevant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Step Guides">
    Create AI-ready procedural guides for each scenario.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Context Engineering?

AI agents are only as good as the knowledge they have access to. Raw documents, scattered PDFs, and unstructured content don't work well for AI. Context engineering transforms your existing knowledge into a format that AI agents can reliably use.

**The result**: AI agents that give accurate, consistent responses based on your actual processes and policies.
