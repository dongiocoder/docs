# Welcome to XOOS

XOOS (XtendOps Operating System) is a platform for building AI-powered customer support systems. The Context Engineering module helps you organize your support knowledge into a structured hierarchy that AI agents can understand and use effectively.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the practice of organizing your support knowledge—procedures, policies, and troubleshooting steps—into a structured format that AI agents can reliably use to help customers.

## The Context Hierarchy

XOOS organizes support knowledge in a three-level hierarchy:

```
Workstream (e.g., "Customer Support Chat")
└── Contact Driver (e.g., "Order Issues")
    └── Sub-Scenario (e.g., "Cancel Order")
        ├── Linked Step Guide
        └── Linked Knowledge Documents
```

This structure ensures AI agents can quickly find the right procedures and information to help customers.
