# Managing Contact Drivers

This guide covers creating, editing, and organizing contact drivers in XOOS.

## Creating a Contact Driver

### From the Workstream Detail Page

1. Navigate to a workstream detail page
2. Click the **Contact Drivers** tab
3. Click **Add Contact Driver**
4. Fill in the required fields
5. Click **Create**

### Required Fields

#### Name

A clear, concise identifier for the contact reason.

**Examples:**
- Order Cancellation
- Password Reset
- Subscription Changes
- Return Request

#### Description

A detailed explanation that helps identify when this contact driver applies.

**Include:**
- What the customer is trying to accomplish
- Common variations of this request
- Any distinguishing characteristics

```
Example: "Customer wants to return a product they purchased.
May be within or outside the return window. Could be due to
defect, wrong item, or change of mind."
```

### Optional Fields

#### Integrations

Select systems involved in handling this contact type:

- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Order management (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Payment processors (Stripe, Square)
- Authentication (Auth0, Okta)
- Communication (Slack, Teams)

#### Metrics

Enter performance data:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Volume | Monthly contact count |
| AHT | Average handle time |
| FCR | First contact resolution rate |
| CSAT | Customer satisfaction score |
| QA Score | Quality assurance score |
| Cost | Cost per interaction |

## Editing Contact Drivers

1. Open the contact driver (click the row or use the view action)
2. Click **Edit** or use the dropdown menu
3. Make changes
4. Click **Save**

## Organizing Contact Drivers

### Within a Workstream

Contact drivers are listed under their parent workstream. To reorganize:

1. Consider whether a contact driver belongs to a different workstream
2. Create a new contact driver in the correct workstream
3. Migrate sub-scenarios if needed
4. Deactivate the old contact driver

### Merging Contact Drivers

If two contact drivers are too similar:

1. Decide which one to keep
2. Move sub-scenarios from the other
3. Update the description to cover both cases
4. Deactivate the redundant contact driver

### Splitting Contact Drivers

If a contact driver is too broad:

1. Create new, more specific contact drivers
2. Distribute sub-scenarios appropriately
3. Write focused descriptions for each
4. Deactivate the original if empty

## Deactivating Contact Drivers

Deactivating preserves data but removes the contact driver from:

- Active views
- AI agent context
- Metric calculations

To deactivate:
1. Open the contact driver dropdown menu
2. Select **Deactivate**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Deactivating a contact driver also affects its sub-scenarios. AI agents will no longer use this context for customer interactions.
</Warning>

## Contact Driver Metrics

Metrics at the contact driver level help identify:

- **High volume** areas needing automation
- **High AHT** processes needing optimization
- **Low CSAT** experiences needing improvement

Update metrics regularly for accurate insights.
