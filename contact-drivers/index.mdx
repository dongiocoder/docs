# Contact Drivers

Contact drivers represent the primary reasons customers reach out to your support team. They sit between workstreams and sub-scenarios in the context hierarchy.

## What is a Contact Driver?

A contact driver answers the question: **"Why is the customer contacting us?"**

Examples:
- Order Issues
- Account Access Problems
- Billing Questions
- Product Returns
- Technical Support Requests

## Contact Driver Structure

Each contact driver contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Short, clear identifier |
| Description | Detailed explanation of the contact reason |
| Integrations | External systems involved |
| Sub-Scenarios | Specific situations within this driver |
| Metrics | Performance data (volume, AHT, CSAT, etc.) |

## Relationship to Workstreams

Contact drivers belong to a parent workstream:

```
Workstream: Customer Support Chat
├── Contact Driver: Order Issues
├── Contact Driver: Account Access
├── Contact Driver: Billing Questions
└── Contact Driver: Product Information
```

A single workstream typically has 5-15 contact drivers covering all the main reasons customers reach out through that channel.

## Integrations

Contact drivers can specify which external systems are involved in resolving inquiries:

- **Salesforce** - CRM lookups
- **Shopify** - Order management
- **Auth0** - Authentication issues
- **Stripe** - Payment processing
- **Slack** - Internal escalation

This helps AI agents know which tools they might need to use.

## Viewing Contact Drivers

Access contact drivers in two ways:

1. **From Workstream**: Click on a workstream, then view its Contact Drivers tab
2. **Direct Navigation**: Go to **Context Engineering** > **Contact Drivers**

The contact drivers table shows:
- Name and description
- Parent workstream
- Number of sub-scenarios
- Key metrics
- Status

## Best Practices

### Naming

- Use clear, action-oriented names
- Be specific but not too granular
- Match language your customers use

**Good:** "Cancel Order", "Reset Password", "Update Payment Method"
**Too broad:** "Help", "Questions", "Issues"
**Too narrow:** "Cancel Order Placed Yesterday with Express Shipping"

### Granularity

Contact drivers should be:
- **Distinct** - Clearly different from each other
- **Complete** - Cover all common contact reasons
- **Balanced** - Similar level of specificity

### Description Quality

Write descriptions that help AI agents understand when this contact driver applies:

```
Good: "Customer wants to cancel an order that has not yet shipped.
      May include requests for refund timeline or confirmation."

Poor: "Order cancellation"
```
