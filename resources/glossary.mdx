# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used in XOOS and context engineering.

---

## A

### AI Agent
An automated system powered by artificial intelligence that uses your Step Guides to help users. AI agents navigate your hierarchy to find the right guidance for each situation.

### AI-Ready Content
Content that has been structured and written specifically for AI agents to use effectively. Step Guides are AI-ready; raw Knowledge documents are not.

---

## C

### Channel
The communication medium used for interactions: chat, email, voice, messaging, social, etc.

### Contact Driver
The second level of the context hierarchy. Represents a category of inquiries or reasons someone reaches out. Examples: "Order Issues", "Account Problems", "Billing Questions".

### Context Engineering
The practice of organizing knowledge into a structured format that AI agents can use effectively. Involves gathering knowledge, defining hierarchy, mapping content, and writing Step Guides.

### Coverage
The extent to which your scenarios have the necessary knowledge and Step Guides. Full coverage means every scenario has linked knowledge and a completed Step Guide.

---

## H

### Hierarchy
The three-level structure used to organize your domain: Workstream → Contact Driver → Scenario. This structure enables AI to navigate from broad to specific.

---

## K

### Knowledge
Raw source materials collected during the first phase of context engineering. Includes training documents, SOPs, policies, templates, and other reference materials. Knowledge is input to the process, not the final output.

### Knowledge Document
An individual piece of content in the Knowledge section. Can be created in the editor or uploaded as a file (PDF, etc.).

---

## M

### Mapping
The process of linking Knowledge documents to Scenarios. Mapping identifies which source materials are relevant to each specific situation.

---

## O

### One-to-One Relationship
The principle that each Scenario has exactly one Step Guide. This eliminates ambiguity about which guide applies to any given situation.

---

## R

### Raw Materials
Another term for Knowledge—the unprocessed source documents collected at the start of context engineering.

---

## S

### Scenario
The most specific level of the context hierarchy. Represents a particular situation that requires specific handling. Examples: "Cancel Order", "Reset Password", "Process Return".

### Step Guide
The finished product of context engineering. A structured, procedural document that tells AI agents exactly how to handle a specific scenario. Step Guides are AI-ready content.

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
A type of Knowledge document containing internal procedures. SOPs are raw materials that inform Step Guide writing.

---

## T

### Tags
Keywords applied to Knowledge documents for organization and filtering. Examples: "returns", "billing", "needs-review".

### Template
A type of Knowledge document containing pre-written content. Templates in the Knowledge section are raw materials; the AI applies them through Step Guide instructions.

### Tribal Knowledge
Undocumented information that exists only in team members' heads. An important source to capture during knowledge gathering.

---

## V

### Version
A snapshot of a Step Guide at a point in time. Versions are numbered sequentially (v1, v2, v3). Only the current version is editable; historical versions are preserved.

### Version Comment
A required note explaining what changed when creating a new Step Guide version. Good comments explain why the change was made.

---

## W

### Workstream
The highest level of the context hierarchy. Represents a broad operational area or channel. Examples: "Customer Support Chat", "Sales Inquiries", "HR Questions".
