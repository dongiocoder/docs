# Sub-Scenarios

Sub-scenarios are the most specific level of the context hierarchy. They represent the exact situation a customer is experiencing within a contact driver.

## What is a Sub-Scenario?

A sub-scenario answers the question: **"What exactly is happening?"**

While a contact driver might be "Order Issues," sub-scenarios break this down into:

- Cancel Order
- Modify Order
- Track Shipment
- Report Missing Items
- Request Refund

## Sub-Scenario Structure

Each sub-scenario contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Specific situation identifier |
| Description | Detailed explanation of the scenario |
| Step Guide | Linked procedural guide |
| Knowledge Documents | Linked reference materials |
| Metrics | Performance data |

## The Context Hierarchy

Sub-scenarios sit at the bottom of the hierarchy:

```
Workstream: Customer Support Email
└── Contact Driver: Order Issues
    ├── Sub-Scenario: Cancel Order
    │   └── Step Guide: Order Cancellation Process
    ├── Sub-Scenario: Modify Order
    │   └── Step Guide: Order Modification Process
    └── Sub-Scenario: Track Shipment
        └── Step Guide: Shipment Tracking Guide
```

## Why Sub-Scenarios Matter

Sub-scenarios enable AI agents to:

1. **Find precise guidance** - Each scenario has specific steps
2. **Apply correct policies** - Different scenarios may have different rules
3. **Use relevant tools** - Some scenarios need specific integrations
4. **Track performance** - Measure success at a granular level

## Example: Order Issues Breakdown

| Contact Driver | Sub-Scenario | Step Guide |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Order Issues | Cancel Order (Not Shipped) | Cancel unshipped orders |
| Order Issues | Cancel Order (Shipped) | Initiate return for shipped orders |
| Order Issues | Modify Address | Change shipping address |
| Order Issues | Modify Items | Add or remove order items |
| Order Issues | Track Shipment | Provide tracking information |
| Order Issues | Missing Items | Report and resolve missing items |

## Linked Content

### Step Guides

Each sub-scenario should link to a step guide that provides:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Decision trees
- Scripts and templates
- Escalation criteria

[Learn more about Step Guides](/step-guides/index)

### Knowledge Documents

Sub-scenarios can also link to reference materials:

- Policies
- FAQs
- Product information
- Technical documentation

## Viewing Sub-Scenarios

Access sub-scenarios through:

1. **Contact Driver Detail**: Click a contact driver, view Sub-Scenarios tab
2. **Direct Navigation**: Go to **Context Engineering** > **Sub-Scenarios**

## Best Practices

### Specificity

Sub-scenarios should be specific enough that:
- The handling process is consistent
- Success can be clearly measured
- AI agents know exactly what to do

### Coverage

Ensure sub-scenarios cover:
- Common variations (80% of cases)
- Important edge cases
- Escalation scenarios

### Linkage

Every sub-scenario should have:
- A linked step guide (for procedures)
- Relevant knowledge documents (for reference)
