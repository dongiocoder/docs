# Key Concepts

Context Engineering in XOOS is built around a hierarchical structure that organizes your support knowledge from broad categories down to specific procedures.

## The Context Hierarchy

```
Workstream
└── Contact Driver
    └── Sub-Scenario
        ├── Step Guide (procedural)
        └── Knowledge Documents (reference)
```

## Workstreams

**Workstreams** are the top-level organizational units representing distinct support channels or functions.

### Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Inbound** | Customer-initiated contacts | Support chat, help desk emails |
| **Outbound** | Company-initiated contacts | Follow-up calls, proactive outreach |
| **Background** | Automated or scheduled tasks | Ticket routing, escalation handling |

### Channels

Workstreams are associated with communication channels:
- **Chat** - Live chat and messaging
- **Email** - Email-based support
- **Voice** - Phone support
- **Social** - Social media channels
- **SMS** - Text messaging

## Contact Drivers

**Contact drivers** represent the primary reasons customers reach out within a workstream. They answer the question: "Why is the customer contacting us?"

### Examples

- Order Issues
- Account Access Problems
- Billing Questions
- Product Returns
- Technical Support

### Attributes

- **Name**: Clear, concise identifier
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the contact reason
- **Integrations**: External systems involved (Salesforce, Shopify, etc.)
- **Metrics**: Volume, AHT, CSAT, and other KPIs

## Sub-Scenarios

**Sub-scenarios** are specific situations within a contact driver. They represent the detailed "what exactly is happening" level.

### Example Structure

```
Contact Driver: Order Issues
├── Sub-Scenario: Cancel Order
├── Sub-Scenario: Modify Order
├── Sub-Scenario: Track Shipment
└── Sub-Scenario: Report Missing Items
```

### Links

Each sub-scenario can be linked to:
- **Step Guide**: A procedural guide for handling the scenario
- **Knowledge Documents**: Reference materials, policies, FAQs

## Step Guides

**Step guides** are procedural documents that tell agents (human or AI) exactly how to handle a situation. They are:

- **Versioned**: Track changes over time
- **Structured**: Written in a consistent, step-by-step format
- **Linkable**: Connected to sub-scenarios for automatic use

## Knowledge Documents

**Knowledge documents** are reference materials that support step guides:

- **Support Articles**: Customer-facing help content
- **SOPs**: Standard operating procedures
- **Policies**: Company policies and guidelines
- **Templates**: Response templates and scripts

## How It All Works Together

When an AI agent receives a customer inquiry:

1. **Identifies the Workstream** based on the channel and context
2. **Determines the Contact Driver** from the customer's intent
3. **Narrows to a Sub-Scenario** based on specific details
4. **Retrieves the Step Guide** for procedural guidance
5. **References Knowledge Documents** for additional context

This structured approach ensures consistent, accurate responses across all customer interactions.
