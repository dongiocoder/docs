## January 2025

### Documentation Refresh

We've completely rewritten our documentation to better reflect the context engineering process:

- **New structure** organized around the workflow phases
- **Guides section** covering principles and best practices
- **Clearer terminology** distinguishing Knowledge from Step Guides
- **Process-driven approach** showing the full workflow from gathering to maintenance

### What's Changed

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| "Sub-Scenarios" | "Scenarios" |
| Feature-focused docs | Process-focused docs |
| Single Documentation tab | Four tabs: Documentation, Guides, API Reference, Changelog |

## Coming Soon

### AI-Assisted Guide Writing

We're working on AI-powered assistance for writing Step Guides. Based on your mapped knowledge, the system will generate initial drafts that you can review and refine.

### API Access

Programmatic access to your context engineering data is in development. See the [API Reference](/api/index) for planned endpoints.

### Enhanced Analytics

Track coverage, identify gaps, and measure the effectiveness of your context engineering efforts.
