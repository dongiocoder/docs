# Scenarios

Scenarios are the most specific level of your hierarchy. Each scenario represents a particular situation that requires a specific response or procedure.

## What is a Scenario?

A scenario answers: **"What exactly is happening?"**

While a contact driver might be "Order Issues," scenarios break this down into specific situations:
- Cancel Order (before shipping)
- Cancel Order (already shipped)
- Modify Order Address
- Add Items to Order
- Track Shipment
- Report Missing Package

## The Goal: One Step Guide Per Scenario

Every scenario will have exactly one Step Guide linked to it. This 1:1 relationship is intentional:

- **No ambiguity**: One situation, one procedure
- **Clear ownership**: Easy to maintain and update
- **Consistent responses**: AI always knows which guide to use

## Creating a Scenario

1. Open a contact driver
2. Click **Add Scenario**
3. Provide the details:

### Name

Specific, action-oriented identifier:
- "Cancel Order" ✓
- "Order cancellation" ✓
- "When customer wants to cancel" ✗ (too verbose)
- "Cancel" ✗ (too vague)

### Description

Detailed explanation of when this scenario applies:

```
Good:
"Customer wants to cancel an order that has not yet shipped.
May include requests for:
- Full cancellation
- Partial cancellation (some items)
- Confirmation of refund timeline

Excludes: Orders that have already shipped (see 'Return Shipped Order')"

Bad:
"Order cancellation"
```

## How Specific Should Scenarios Be?

### Too Broad
```
Scenario: Handle Order Issues
→ Covers too many different procedures
→ Step guide would be confusingly long
→ Split into specific scenarios
```

### Too Narrow
```
Scenario: Cancel Order for Blue Widget on Tuesday
→ Too specific, not reusable
→ Combine into "Cancel Order"
```

### Just Right
```
Scenario: Cancel Order (Not Shipped)
→ Specific situation
→ Clear procedure
→ Reusable across similar situations
```

## Scenario Design Principles

### Distinct Procedures

If two scenarios require different procedures, they should be separate:

```
✅ Separate (different procedures):
- Cancel Order (Not Shipped) → Process refund immediately
- Cancel Order (Shipped) → Initiate return process
```

### Similar Procedures = One Scenario

If situations are handled the same way, combine them:

```
✅ Combined (same procedure):
- "Update Shipping Address" covers:
  - Change street address
  - Change city
  - Change postal code
```

### Edge Cases

Include scenarios for important edge cases:

```
Standard scenarios:
- Process Standard Return

Edge case scenarios:
- Process Return (Outside Window)
- Process Return (Damaged Item)
- Process Return (Wrong Item Sent)
```

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming helps everyone:

### Pattern: [Action] + [Subject] + [Qualifier]

```
Examples:
- Cancel Order (Not Shipped)
- Process Return (Standard)
- Reset Password (Locked Account)
- Upgrade Plan (From Trial)
```

### Alternative: [Subject] - [Specific Situation]

```
Examples:
- Order - Cancel Before Shipping
- Return - Standard Process
- Password - Reset After Lockout
- Plan - Upgrade From Trial
```

Pick one pattern and use it consistently.

## Scenario Checklist

Before finalizing scenarios, verify:

<Accordion title="Scenario Quality Checklist">
- [ ] Name clearly identifies the situation
- [ ] Description explains when this applies
- [ ] Different from similar scenarios
- [ ] Requires a distinct procedure
- [ ] Not too broad (needs splitting)
- [ ] Not too narrow (can be combined)
- [ ] Uses consistent naming pattern
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
</Accordion>

## Managing Scenarios

### Linking Knowledge

After creating scenarios, link relevant knowledge documents:
1. Open the scenario
2. Go to **Knowledge** section
3. Link documents that relate to this scenario

### Linking Step Guides

Once you've written a step guide:
1. Open the scenario
2. Go to **Step Guide** section
3. Link the appropriate guide

## Next Steps

With scenarios defined:
1. [Map Knowledge to Scenarios](/mapping/index)
2. [Write Step Guides](/step-guides/index)
