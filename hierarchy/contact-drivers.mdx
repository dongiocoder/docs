# Contact Drivers

Contact drivers are the second level of your hierarchy. They represent the main reasons or categories of inquiries within each workstream.

## What is a Contact Driver?

A contact driver answers: **"Why is someone reaching out?"**

Each workstream contains multiple contact drivers that cover the major categories of inquiries it handles.

## Examples

### Under "Customer Support Chat"
- Order Issues
- Account Problems
- Billing Questions
- Product Returns
- Shipping Inquiries

### Under "Sales Inquiries"
- Pricing Questions
- Product Comparison
- Feature Requests
- Trial Extensions
- Enterprise Inquiries

### Under "HR Support"
- Benefits Questions
- Time Off Requests
- Policy Clarifications
- Payroll Issues
- Workplace Concerns

## Creating a Contact Driver

1. Open a workstream
2. Click **Add Contact Driver**
3. Fill in the details:

### Name

Clear, concise identifier:
- "Order Issues" ✓
- "Problems with orders and stuff" ✗
- "OI" ✗ (too abbreviated)

### Description

Explain what this contact driver covers:

```
Good:
"Inquiries about existing orders including modifications,
cancellations, tracking, and issues with received items."

Bad:
"Order stuff"
```

The description helps:
- Team members understand scope
- AI categorize inquiries correctly
- Identify overlaps with other drivers

### Integrations (Optional)

Systems involved in handling these inquiries:
- Shopify (order management)
- Stripe (payments)
- Shipping carriers (tracking)

## How Many Contact Drivers?

Per workstream guidelines:

| Workstream Size | Contact Drivers |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Focused | 3-5 |
| Standard | 5-10 |
| Complex | 10-15 |
| Very Complex | 15-20 |

<Tip>
Aim for contact drivers that each contain 5-15 scenarios. If a contact driver has 30+ scenarios, consider splitting it. If it has only 1-2 scenarios, consider merging.
</Tip>

## Designing Good Contact Drivers

### Mutually Exclusive

Each inquiry should clearly belong to one contact driver:

```
❌ Overlapping:
- Refund Questions
- Billing Issues
- Payment Problems

✅ Distinct:
- Refunds & Returns
- Billing & Invoicing
- Payment Methods
```

### Collectively Exhaustive

Together, contact drivers should cover all scenarios in the workstream:

```
❌ Gaps:
- Orders (what about non-order questions?)
- Shipping (what about products?)

✅ Complete:
- Orders & Shipping
- Products & Catalog
- Account & Profile
- Billing & Payments
```

### User-Centric Language

Use language that matches how users describe their issues:

```
❌ Internal jargon:
- SKU Discrepancies
- Fulfillment Exceptions

✅ User language:
- Wrong Item Received
- Delivery Problems
```

## Organizing Contact Drivers

### By User Goal

What is the user trying to accomplish?
- Get Help with Order
- Manage Account
- Make a Purchase

### By Topic Area

What subject does this relate to?
- Orders & Shipping
- Products & Inventory
- Billing & Payments

### By Urgency (if relevant)

How quickly does this need resolution?
- Urgent Issues
- Standard Requests
- General Inquiries

## Managing Contact Drivers

### Moving Between Workstreams

If a contact driver belongs to a different workstream:
1. Create the contact driver in the correct workstream
2. Move or recreate its scenarios
3. Delete the original

### Merging Contact Drivers

If two contact drivers overlap too much:
1. Decide which to keep
2. Move scenarios from the other
3. Delete the empty one

### Splitting Contact Drivers

If a contact driver is too large:
1. Create new, more specific contact drivers
2. Distribute scenarios appropriately
3. Delete the original if empty

## Next Steps

With contact drivers defined:
1. [Create Scenarios](/hierarchy/scenarios)
2. [Map Knowledge to Scenarios](/mapping/index)
