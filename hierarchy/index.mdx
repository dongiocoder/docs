# Define Hierarchy

The hierarchy is the backbone of your context engineering project. It organizes your domain into a clear structure that enables AI to navigate and find the right guidance.

## The Three Levels

```
Workstream (Broad Area)
└── Contact Driver (Category)
    └── Scenario (Specific Situation)
```

### Workstreams

The highest level. Represents broad operational areas.

**Examples:**
- Customer Support Chat
- Sales Inquiries
- HR Questions
- IT Help Desk

### Contact Drivers

Categories within a workstream. Represents the main reasons someone reaches out.

**Examples under "Customer Support":**
- Order Issues
- Account Problems
- Billing Questions
- Product Returns

### Scenarios

Specific situations within a contact driver. The most granular level.

**Examples under "Order Issues":**
- Cancel Order
- Modify Order
- Track Shipment
- Report Missing Items

## Why Structure Matters

A good hierarchy provides:

### Scalability
- Add new scenarios without chaos
- Grow from 10 to 1000 scenarios manageably
- Multiple team members can work independently

### Clarity
- Everyone knows where things belong
- No confusion about which guide applies
- Easy to identify gaps

### AI Navigation
- AI can quickly narrow down to the right scenario
- Clear path from broad to specific
- Consistent responses across situations

## Two Approaches

### 1. Mirror the Client's Structure

If the client already has categories, queues, or organizational structures:

**Pros:**
- Familiar to existing team
- Matches current workflows
- Easier adoption

**Cons:**
- May inherit suboptimal structure
- Legacy categories may not fit AI well

### 2. Design Optimal Structure

Start fresh based on the knowledge gathered:

**Pros:**
- Optimized for AI
- Clean, logical organization
- No legacy baggage

**Cons:**
- Requires more upfront analysis
- May differ from existing processes

<Tip>
There's no wrong choice. Pick the approach that works for your situation. You can always refine the structure later.

## Designing Your Hierarchy

### Start with Outcomes

Ask: "What is someone trying to accomplish?"

Instead of organizing by department or system, organize by user goals:

```
❌ Organized by system:
- Shopify Issues
- Zendesk Issues
- Payment Gateway Issues

✅ Organized by goal:
- Order Management
- Account Access
- Payment Problems
```

### Keep It Balanced

Aim for similar depth across the hierarchy:

```
❌ Unbalanced:
- Workstream A
  - 2 contact drivers
    - 5 scenarios each
- Workstream B
  - 15 contact drivers
    - 50 scenarios each

✅ Balanced:
- Workstream A
  - 5 contact drivers
    - 8-12 scenarios each
- Workstream B
  - 6 contact drivers
    - 8-12 scenarios each
```

### Avoid Overlap

Each scenario should be distinct:

```
❌ Overlapping:
- Scenario: Cancel Order
- Scenario: Order Cancellation Request

✅ Distinct:
- Scenario: Cancel Order (Not Shipped)
- Scenario: Cancel Order (Already Shipped)
```
