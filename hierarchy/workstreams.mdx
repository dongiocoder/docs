# Workstreams

Workstreams are the highest level of your hierarchy. They represent broad operational areas or channels.

## What Makes a Good Workstream?

A workstream should be:

- **Distinct**: Clearly different from other workstreams
- **Broad**: Covers a significant area of operations
- **Logical**: Makes sense as a grouping to your team

## Examples by Industry

### Customer Support
- Inbound Support Chat
- Inbound Support Email
- Outbound Follow-ups
- Self-Service (Background)

### Sales
- Lead Qualification
- Product Inquiries
- Pricing Discussions
- Renewal Conversations

### HR
- Employee Questions
- Benefits Inquiries
- Policy Questions
- Onboarding Support

### IT
- Technical Support
- Access Requests
- Hardware Issues
- Software Problems

## Creating a Workstream

1. Navigate to **Context Engineering** > **Workstreams**
2. Click **Create Workstream**
3. Enter the required information:

### Name

A clear, descriptive name:
- "Customer Support Chat" ✓
- "Support" ✗ (too vague)
- "Q4 2024 Holiday Chat Support Initiative" ✗ (too specific)

### Type

Select the type that matches the workstream's nature:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Inbound** | Incoming contacts initiated by customers/users |
| **Outbound** | Proactive outreach initiated by your team |
| **Background** | Automated or behind-the-scenes processes |

### Channel (Optional)

The communication channel:
- Chat
- Email
- Voice
- Messaging
- Social

### Platform (Optional)

The system used:
- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Gladly
- Salesforce
- Custom

## How Many Workstreams?

Guidelines:

| Scale | Typical Workstreams |
|-------|---------------------|
| Small | 1-3 |
| Medium | 3-6 |
| Large | 6-12 |
| Enterprise | 10+ |

<Warning>
More isn't always better. Too many workstreams can fragment your knowledge. Start with fewer and split later if needed.
</Warning>

## Organizing Workstreams

### By Channel

One workstream per channel:
- Customer Support - Chat
- Customer Support - Email
- Customer Support - Phone

**Pros**: Clean separation, channel-specific procedures
**Cons**: Duplicate scenarios across channels

### By Function

One workstream per function:
- Sales Support
- Technical Support
- Billing Support

**Pros**: Expertise-based grouping
**Cons**: May span multiple channels

### Hybrid

Combine approaches:
- Inbound Support (all channels)
- Sales Inquiries
- Technical Escalations

**Pros**: Flexible, practical
**Cons**: Requires clear boundaries

## Managing Workstreams

### Editing

1. Open the workstream
2. Click **Edit** or use the dropdown menu
3. Update details
4. Save changes

### Deactivating

When a workstream is no longer needed:
- **Deactivate** keeps history, hides from active views
- **Delete** removes permanently (not recommended)

## Next Steps
