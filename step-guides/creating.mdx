# Creating Step Guides

This guide covers how to create step guides that effectively guide AI agents and human support staff.

## Creating a New Step Guide

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Step Guides**
2. Click **Create Step Guide**
3. Fill in the metadata
4. Write your content
5. Click **Save**

## Required Fields

### Title

A clear, action-oriented title.

**Good titles:**
- "Processing Return Requests"
- "Resolving Login Authentication Errors"
- "Handling Billing Disputes"

**Avoid:**
- "Returns" (too vague)
- "Steps" (not descriptive)
- "How to process return requests for customers who want to return items they purchased" (too long)

### Description

A brief summary (1-2 sentences) explaining:
- When this guide applies
- What the outcome should be

```
Example: "Use this guide when a customer wants to return a product.
Covers both within-window and exception returns."
```

### Best Practices

#### Be Explicit

**Good:**
```
1. Open the customer's order in Shopify
2. Click "More Actions" > "Cancel Order"
3. Select the reason: "Customer Request"
4. Check "Refund payment"
5. Click "Cancel Order"
```

**Bad:**
```
1. Cancel the order in the system
2. Process the refund
```

#### Include Decision Logic

```markdown
### Determine Refund Amount

**Full Refund** - When:
- Original packaging is intact
- Within 30-day window
- No signs of use

**Partial Refund (80%)** - When:
- Packaging opened but item unused
- Within 30-day window

**No Refund** - When:
- Outside return window
- Item shows signs of use
- Refer to supervisor for exceptions
```

#### Provide Language Examples

```markdown
### Confirming with Customer

Use this language:
> "I've processed your return request. You'll receive a full refund
> of $[amount] within 3-5 business days. Is there anything else
> I can help you with today?"
```

#### Specify Escalation Clearly

```markdown
## When to Escalate

**Escalate immediately to Supervisor if:**
- Refund amount exceeds $500
- Customer threatens legal action
- Return involves safety issue

**Escalate to Returns Team if:**
- Item is from a restricted category
- International return with customs issues
```

## Using the Editor

The step guide editor supports:

| Feature | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Headings | Organize sections (H2, H3) |
| Bold | Emphasize key terms |
| Lists | Step sequences, options |
| Tables | Decision matrices |
| Links | Reference other content |
| Blockquotes | Sample language |

## Saving and Publishing

Step guides save as the "current" version immediately. There's no draft state—saved content is immediately available.

To prepare content without making it live:
1. Write in a separate document first
2. Don't link to sub-scenarios until ready
3. Or mark as inactive until complete

## After Creation

Once saved:

1. **Link to sub-scenarios** - Connect the guide to relevant scenarios
2. **Test with AI** - If available, test how the agent uses the guide
3. **Get feedback** - Have team members review
4. **Iterate** - Make updates based on real usage
