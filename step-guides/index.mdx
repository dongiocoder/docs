# Step Guides

Step Guides are the **finished product** of context engineering. They are structured, procedural documents that AI agents actually use to help users.

## The Key Distinction

<Warning>
**Remember**: Knowledge documents are raw materials. Step Guides are the processed, AI-ready output.

- **Knowledge**: What you collect (ingredients)
- **Step Guides**: What AI uses (finished dish)
</Warning>

## What Makes a Step Guide?

Step Guides are:

### Structured
- Clear step-by-step format
- Consistent organization
- Predictable layout

### Procedural
- Action-oriented instructions
- Decision points clearly marked
- Outcomes specified

### AI-Ready
- Written for AI consumption
- Unambiguous language
- Complete information

### Versioned
- Track changes over time
- Historical versions preserved
- Clear change documentation

## One Guide Per Scenario

Every scenario gets exactly **one** Step Guide. This 1:1 relationship ensures:

- **No ambiguity**: AI knows exactly which guide to use
- **Clear maintenance**: Updates go to one place
- **Consistent responses**: Same situation, same procedure

## The Writing Process

### 1. Gather Your References

Before writing, collect:
- Knowledge documents linked to the scenario
- The scenario's description
- Any existing procedures or notes

### 2. Understand the Goal

What should happen when this guide is followed correctly?
- What's the desired outcome?
- What does success look like?

### 3. Write the Steps

Create clear, actionable instructions:
- Start with prerequisites
- Provide step-by-step actions
- Include decision points
- Define escalation criteria

### 4. Test and Refine

Review the guide:
- Can you follow it without confusion?
- Does it cover edge cases?
- Is anything ambiguous?

## Step Guide Structure

A typical Step Guide includes:

```
Title: [Clear, action-oriented title]

Description: When and why to use this guide

Prerequisites:
- What's needed before starting
- Required access or permissions

Steps:
1. First action
2. Second action
3. Decision point: If X, do Y; if Z, do W
4. Continue...

Escalation:
- When to escalate
- Who to escalate to

Related Information:
- Links to policies or references
```

## Currently Manual

Today, writing Step Guides is a manual process. You:
1. Review the linked knowledge
2. Synthesize the information
3. Write clear procedures

<Note>
**Coming Soon**: AI-assisted guide writing will use your mapped knowledge to help generate initial drafts. You'll review and refine rather than write from scratch.
</Note>

## Why Step Guides Matter

When an AI agent encounters a scenario:

1. **Identifies the scenario** from the user's inquiry
2. **Retrieves the linked Step Guide**
3. **Follows the procedure** to help the user
4. **Applies the guidance** consistently

Good Step Guides = Consistent, accurate AI responses

## Quality Standards

Step Guides should be:

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Complete** | All steps included, no gaps |
| **Clear** | Unambiguous language, specific actions |
| **Accurate** | Reflects current policies and procedures |
| **Consistent** | Same format across all guides |
| **Maintained** | Updated when procedures change |
