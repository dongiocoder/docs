# Step Guides

Step guides are procedural documents that provide step-by-step instructions for handling specific scenarios. They are the primary source of guidance for AI agents when helping customers.

## What is a Step Guide?

A step guide tells an agent (human or AI) exactly how to handle a situation:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Decision points and branches
- Scripts and language to use
- Escalation criteria
- Related information to reference

## Step Guides vs. Knowledge Documents

| Step Guides | Knowledge Documents |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Procedural | Informational |
| "Do this, then this" | "Here's the policy" |
| Linked 1:1 to sub-scenarios | Linked many-to-many |
| Versioned | Not versioned |
| Active guidance | Reference material |

## Key Features

### Versioning

Step guides support full version control:

- Track changes over time

- Formatted text (bold, italic, lists)
- Headings and structure
- Tables for decision matrices
- Links to other resources
- Code blocks for technical content

### Linking

Each step guide can be linked to sub-scenarios:

```

## How AI Agents Use Step Guides

When an AI agent identifies a sub-scenario:

1. **Retrieves linked step guide** - Gets the current version
2. **Follows the structure** - Uses steps as procedural guidance
3. **Makes decisions** - Uses decision points to branch
4. **References knowledge** - Links to additional context
5. **Knows when to escalate** - Follows escalation criteria

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Guides

- **Be specific** - Include exact steps, not vague directions
- **Cover edge cases** - Address common variations
- **Use consistent language** - Match your support tone
- **Keep it current** - Update when processes change

### Organization

- One guide per procedure
- Link to multiple sub-scenarios if appropriate
- Cross-reference related guides
- Archive outdated guides
