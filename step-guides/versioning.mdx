# Step Guide Versioning

Step guides support full version control, allowing you to track changes, maintain history, and ensure AI agents always use the correct procedures.

## How Versioning Works

### Version States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Current** | The active, editable version |
| **Historical** | Frozen snapshots of previous versions |

- Only the **current** version can be edited
- **Historical** versions are read-only records
- Scenarios always link to the current version

### Version Numbers

Versions are numbered sequentially: v1, v2, v3, etc.

```
Step Guide: Return Processing
├── v3 (current) - Active, editable
├── v2 (historical) - Frozen
└── v1 (historical) - Frozen
```

## Creating a New Version

When you make significant changes to a step guide, you create a new version:

1. Open the step guide
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make your changes
4. Click **Save as New Version**
5. Add a **version comment** explaining the changes
6. Click **Confirm**

### Version Comments

Version comments are required and should explain what changed:

**Good comments:**
- "Updated refund process to include new 45-day window policy"
- "Added escalation criteria for high-value orders"
- "Fixed incorrect step 3 instructions for Shopify integration"

**Poor comments:**
- "Updates"
- "Fixed"
- "Changes"

## Viewing Version History

To see all versions of a step guide:

1. Open the step guide
2. Click **Version History** or the version indicator
3. Browse the list of versions
4. Click any version to view its content

The history shows:
- Version number
- Version comment
- Created by (user)
- Created date

## Comparing Versions

To understand what changed between versions:

1. Open Version History
2. Select a historical version
3. Compare content side-by-side with current
4. Or view the version comment for summary

## When to Create New Versions

**Create a new version when:**
- Changing the actual procedure or steps
- Updating policy-related content
- Correcting significant errors
- Adding new decision paths

**Don't create a new version for:**
- Fixing typos
- Minor rewording without meaning change
- Formatting adjustments

Minor edits update the current version without creating history.

## Restoring Previous Versions

If you need to revert to a previous version:

1. Open Version History
2. Find the desired version
3. Click **Restore**
4. Add a version comment (e.g., "Reverted to v2 due to policy rollback")
5. Confirm

This creates a new version with the previous content—it doesn't delete the current version.

## Version Audit Trail

Each version records:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Version Number | Sequential identifier |
| Version Comment | Explanation of changes |
| Created At | When this version was created |
| Created By | User who created the version |
| Updated At | Last edit to this version |
| Updated By | User who last edited |

This provides a complete audit trail for compliance and quality assurance.

## Impact on AI Agents

When a new version is created:

- Scenarios automatically use the new version
- No relinking required
- AI agents immediately use updated content

<Note>
After creating a significant new version, consider testing with your AI agents to ensure the updated procedures work correctly.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Regular Updates

- Review step guides quarterly
- Update when processes change
- Archive guides that are no longer relevant

### Clear Comments

- Write comments for your future self
- Include context about why changes were made
- Reference related changes (policy updates, system changes)

### Version Discipline

- Don't create excessive versions for minor edits
- Do create versions for any meaningful procedural change
- Keep the current version accurate and up-to-date

### Team Coordination

- Communicate version updates to your team
- Consider a review process for significant changes
- Document who is responsible for maintaining each guide
