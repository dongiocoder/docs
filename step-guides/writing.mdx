## The Writing Process

### Step 1: Create the Guide

3. Enter a title and description

### Step 2: Write the Content

Use the editor to write your guide. Follow the structure below.

### Step 3: Link to Scenario

1. Open the relevant scenario
2. Find **Step Guide** section
3. Link your new guide

## Recommended Structure

### Title

Clear, action-oriented:
- "Processing a Standard Return" ✓
- "Return Stuff" ✗
- "What to Do When Customer Returns Something" ✗

### Description

Brief summary of when this guide applies:

```
Use this guide when a customer wants to return a product
within the 30-day return window under standard conditions.

Excludes:
- Returns outside the window (see "Process Late Return")
- Damaged items (see "Process Damaged Item Return")
```

### Prerequisites

What's needed before starting:

```
## Prerequisites

- Customer identity verified
- Order located in system
- Return reason confirmed
```

### Steps

The main procedure:

```
## Steps

### 1. Verify Eligibility

Check that the item qualifies for return:
- Within 30-day window
- Item is in original packaging
- Not a final sale item

### 2. Create Return Label

In the order system:
1. Click "Create Return"
2. Select items being returned
3. Generate shipping label
4. Email label to customer

### 3. Confirm with Customer

Inform the customer:
- Return label has been emailed
- Refund will process within 3-5 business days after receipt
- Original payment method will be credited
```

### Decision Points

For situations with branches:

```
### Handle Based on Condition

**If item is unopened:**
- Process full refund

**If item is opened but unused:**
- Process full refund
- Note condition in system

**If item shows signs of use:**
- Escalate to supervisor
- Do not promise refund
```

### Escalation Criteria

When to hand off:

```
## Escalation

Escalate to supervisor if:
- Refund amount exceeds $500
- Customer is threatening or abusive
- Item is from restricted category
- Customer disputes policy
```

```

## Writing Tips

### Be Specific

```
❌ Vague:
"Process the return in the system"

✅ Specific:
"In Shopify Admin, click Orders > [Order Number] > More Actions > Create Return"
```

### Use Consistent Formatting

Pick a format and stick with it:
- Numbered steps for sequences
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for emphasis
- Consistent heading levels

### Include Examples

When helpful:

```
Example customer message:
"I'd like to cancel my order #12345 that I placed yesterday."

Example response:
"I've canceled order #12345 and initiated a full refund of $49.99
to your original payment method. You should see this within
3-5 business days."
```

### Cover Edge Cases

Don't just document the happy path:

```
### If Order Cannot Be Found

If the order number doesn't exist:
1. Ask customer to verify the order number
2. Search by email address
3. If still not found, escalate to order support team
```

### Avoid Jargon

Use language the AI can understand and communicate clearly:

```
❌ Jargon:
"Initiate the RMA workflow via the OMS"

✅ Clear:
"Create a return request in the Order Management System"
```

## Common Mistakes

### Too Vague

Guide says: "Handle appropriately"
Problem: AI doesn't know what's appropriate
Fix: Specify exactly what to do

### Missing Steps

Guide jumps from step 2 to step 4
Problem: AI can't fill gaps
Fix: Include every step

### Outdated Information

Guide references old policy
Problem: AI gives wrong information
Fix: Update guides when policies change

### Assuming Context

Guide says: "Continue as usual"
Problem: AI doesn't know "usual"
Fix: Spell out the procedure
