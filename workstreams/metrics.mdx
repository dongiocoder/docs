# Workstream Metrics

XOOS tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) at the workstream level to help you understand and optimize your support operations.

## Available Metrics

### Volume

The number of contacts handled by this workstream.

- Typically measured monthly
- Can be aggregated from contact drivers
- Helps with capacity planning

### Average Handle Time (AHT)

The average time to resolve a contact, displayed as a duration (e.g., "4m 32s").

**Components:**
- Talk/response time
- Hold time
- After-contact work

### First Contact Resolution (FCR)

Percentage of contacts resolved on the first interaction without follow-up.

**Target:** Most organizations aim for 70-80% FCR.

### Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Customer satisfaction score, typically collected via post-interaction surveys.

**Scale:** Usually 1-5 or 1-100, displayed as a percentage.

### QA Score

Quality assurance score based on internal evaluation of agent performance.

**Evaluates:**
- Accuracy of information provided
- Adherence to procedures
- Communication quality

### Cost Per Interaction

The average cost to handle a single contact in this workstream.

**Calculated from:**
- Labor costs
- Platform costs
- Overhead allocation

## Viewing Metrics

Metrics appear in the workstream table and detail views:

| Metric | Column | Format |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Volume | Volume | Number |
| AHT | AHT | Duration (e.g., "4m 32s") |
| FCR | FCR | Percentage |
| CSAT | CSAT | Percentage |
| QA Score | QA Score | Percentage |
| Cost | Cost/Interaction | Currency |

## Editing Metrics

To update workstream metrics:

1. Click on a workstream to open its details
2. Navigate to the **Metrics** section
3. Click **Edit** or use inline editing
4. Update the values
5. Save changes

<Note>
Metrics are currently entered manually. Future versions will support automated metric imports from connected CX platforms.
</Note>

## Metrics Rollup

Workstream metrics can be calculated from contact driver data:

```
Workstream Volume = Sum of all Contact Driver Volumes
Workstream AHT = Weighted average of Contact Driver AHTs
```

## Using Metrics

Metrics help you:

- **Identify problem areas** - High AHT or low CSAT indicates issues
- **Prioritize improvements** - Focus on high-volume, low-performing areas
- **Track AI impact** - Compare metrics before and after AI deployment
- **Plan capacity** - Use volume trends for staffing decisions
