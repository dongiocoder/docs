# Workstreams

Workstreams are the top-level organizational units in XOOS Context Engineering. They represent distinct support channels or operational functions within your organization.

## What is a Workstream?

A workstream groups related support activities by:

- **Communication channel** (chat, email, voice)
- **Direction** (inbound, outbound, background)
- **Platform** (Zendesk, Intercom, Gladly)

Think of workstreams as the different "queues" or "teams" in your support organization.

## Workstream Types

### Inbound

Customer-initiated contacts where your team responds to incoming requests.

**Examples:**
- Customer support chat
- Help desk email queue
- Inbound phone support

### Outbound

Company-initiated contacts where your team proactively reaches out.

**Examples:**
- Follow-up calls
- Proactive customer outreach
- Survey campaigns

### Background

Automated or scheduled tasks that happen without direct customer interaction.

**Examples:**
- Ticket routing and classification
- Automated escalation handling
- Quality assurance reviews

## Workstream Channels

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Chat | Live chat and real-time messaging |
| Email | Asynchronous email support |
| Voice | Phone and voice-based support |
| Messaging | SMS and messaging apps |
| Social | Social media platforms |

## Platform Integration

Workstreams can be connected to CX platforms:

- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Gladly
- Salesforce Service Cloud
- Freshdesk

This integration helps track metrics and route context to the right AI agents.
