# Map Knowledge

Mapping is the bridge between your raw knowledge and your structured scenarios. It creates the connection that tells you "this document is relevant for this scenario."

## Why Mapping Matters

### For Step Guide Writing

When you write a step guide for a scenario, you need to know:
- What source materials to reference
- What policies apply
- What templates exist

Mapping gives you this information at a glance.

### For Coverage Tracking

Mapping helps you identify:
- Scenarios without knowledge (missing sources)
- Knowledge without scenarios (orphaned documents)
- Gaps in your documentation

### For Future AI Assistance

When AI-assisted guide writing becomes available, it will use your mappings to know which documents to reference when generating guides.

## What to Map

Link knowledge documents that are relevant to each scenario:

### Primary Sources
Documents directly about this scenario:
- SOPs for this specific procedure
- Policies that apply
- Templates to use

### Reference Materials
Documents that provide context:
- Product information referenced in the procedure
- Related policies for edge cases
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

### Don't Over-Map

Only link documents that someone would actually reference when handling this scenario. Tangentially related documents add noise.

## The Mapping Process

### Approach 1: Scenario-First

For each scenario:
1. Open the scenario
2. Think: "What documents would I need to handle this?"
3. Search your knowledge base
4. Link the relevant documents

### Approach 2: Document-First

For each document:
1. Open the knowledge document
2. Think: "Which scenarios would use this?"
3. Link it to those scenarios

### Recommended: Hybrid

1. Start with scenario-first for your most important scenarios
2. Then do document-first to catch unmapped documents

## Practical Steps

### Linking Knowledge to a Scenario

1. Navigate to the scenario
2. Find the **Linked Knowledge** section
3. Click **Link Document**
4. Search or browse available documents
5. Select relevant documents
6. Click **Add**

### Viewing What's Linked

Each scenario shows its linked documents. You can:
- View the document
- Remove the link
- Add additional documents

## Coverage Analysis

After mapping, analyze your coverage:

### Well-Covered Scenario
```
Scenario: Cancel Order (Not Shipped)
├── Linked: SOP - Order Cancellation Process
├── Linked: Policy - Refund Timeline
├── Linked: Template - Cancellation Confirmation Email
└── Status: Ready for step guide writing
```

### Under-Covered Scenario
```
Scenario: Process International Return
├── Linked: (none)
└── Status: Missing source materials!
```

### Over-Mapped Scenario
```
Scenario: Reset Password
├── Linked: Account Security Overview
├── Linked: Password Policy
├── Linked: Company History (not relevant!)
├── Linked: Employee Handbook (not relevant!)
└── Status: Needs cleanup
```

## Mapping Best Practices

### Start Broad, Then Refine

1. First pass: Link obviously relevant documents
2. Second pass: Add supporting documents
3. Third pass: Remove tangentially related documents

### Use Tags for Organization

Tag your knowledge documents with the scenarios they relate to:
- `mapped-to:order-cancellation`
- `used-in:returns`

### Track Unmapped Documents

Keep a list of documents not yet linked to any scenario. These might indicate:
- Missing scenarios in your hierarchy
- Outdated documents to archive
- General reference materials that don't map to specific scenarios

### Regular Review

As your knowledge base grows:
- Review new documents for mapping
- Check scenarios when procedures change
- Remove links to archived documents
