# Linking Knowledge

This guide provides detailed instructions for linking knowledge documents to scenarios in XOOS.

## Before You Start

Ensure you have:
- Knowledge documents uploaded to the Knowledge section
- Hierarchy defined (Workstreams → Contact Drivers → Scenarios)
- Clear understanding of what each scenario covers

## Linking from a Scenario

### Step 1: Open the Scenario

1. Navigate to **Context Engineering**
2. Open the relevant **Workstream**
3. Open the relevant **Contact Driver**
4. Click on the **Scenario** you want to map

### Step 2: Find the Knowledge Section

In the scenario detail view, locate the **Linked Knowledge** or **Knowledge Documents** section.

### Step 3: Add Documents

1. Click **Link Document** or **Add**
2. Use the search box to find documents by title
3. Or browse by category
4. Click on documents to select them
5. Click **Add** or **Link** to confirm

### Step 4: Review and Organize

After linking:
- Review the list of linked documents
- Remove any that aren't directly relevant
- Note any missing documents

## Linking from a Document

You can also link in the opposite direction:

### Step 1: Open the Document

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** > **Documents**
2. Click on the document you want to map

### Step 2: Find Linked Scenarios

Look for **Linked Scenarios** or **Used In** section.

### Step 3: Add Scenario Links

1. Click **Link to Scenario**
2. Navigate the hierarchy to find scenarios
3. Select scenarios where this document applies
4. Confirm the links

## What to Link

### Always Link

- **Primary SOP**: The main procedure document for this scenario
- **Applicable Policies**: Rules that affect how this scenario is handled
- **Required Templates**: Templates agents need to use

### Consider Linking

- **Reference Materials**: Product info, system docs
- **Related SOPs**: For edge cases or escalations
- **Training Materials**: If they contain relevant details

### Don't Link

- **General Documents**: Company history, unrelated policies
- **Outdated Materials**: Superseded procedures
- **Tangential Content**: Documents that mention but don't explain the topic

## Managing Links

### Removing a Link

1. Open the scenario
2. Find the linked document
3. Click **Remove** or the unlink icon
4. Confirm removal

### Replacing a Link

When a document is replaced by an updated version:
1. Link the new document
2. Remove the old document
3. The scenario now references current information

## Bulk Operations

For large-scale mapping:

### By Category

1. Filter knowledge documents by category
2. Work through each category
3. Link each document to relevant scenarios

### By Workstream

1. Open one workstream at a time
2. Work through all its scenarios
3. Complete one workstream before moving to the next

### By Document Type

1. Start with SOPs (most important)
2. Then policies
3. Then templates
4. Finally, reference materials

## Tracking Progress

### Using Tags

Add tags to track mapping status:
- On scenarios: `has-knowledge`, `needs-knowledge`
- On documents: `mapped`, `unmapped`, `needs-review`

### Using a Checklist

Create a simple tracking sheet:

| Scenario | Primary SOP | Policies | Templates | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Cancel Order | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Ready |
| Modify Order | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | Missing policy |
| Track Shipment | ✗ | - | - | Needs SOP |

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find a Document

- Check if it's been uploaded
- Try different search terms
- Verify you have access to the document

### Document Seems Relevant to Many Scenarios

This is normal for policy documents. Link to all scenarios where the policy applies.

### Scenario Has No Relevant Documents

This indicates a gap:
- Is there tribal knowledge to document?
- Does this procedure need to be created?
- Is the scenario too specific?
