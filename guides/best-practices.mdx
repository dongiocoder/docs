# Best Practices

These practices have been refined through real-world context engineering projects. Apply them to make your work more efficient and effective.

## Knowledge Gathering

### Cast a Wide Net First

Collect more than you think you need:
- Request all documentation, even if it seems tangential
- Interview subject matter experts
- Document tribal knowledge
- Include edge cases and exceptions

You can always discard irrelevant material, but missing knowledge is hard to recover.

### Create a Knowledge Checklist

Before declaring knowledge gathering "complete":

```
□ Training materials (all departments)
□ SOPs and process docs
□ Policy documents
□ Templates and macros
□ FAQ documents
□ System documentation
□ Tribal knowledge documented
□ Edge cases noted
□ Stakeholder sign-off
```

### Tag Everything

Use consistent tags from the start:
- `source:training`, `source:wiki`, `source:interview`
- `status:verified`, `status:needs-review`
- `topic:orders`, `topic:returns`

Tags make filtering and organizing much easier later.

## Hierarchy Design

### Start with the 80/20 Rule

Design for the 80% of common scenarios first:

1. Identify the most frequent inquiry types
2. Build hierarchy for those first
3. Add edge cases and exceptions later

### Use Consistent Naming

Establish a naming convention and enforce it:

```
Pattern: [Action] [Subject] ([Qualifier])

Examples:
✓ Cancel Order (Before Shipping)
✓ Process Return (Standard)
✓ Reset Password (After Lockout)

Not:
✗ Order Cancellation
✗ When customer wants return
✗ password reset process
```

### Design for the Future

Leave room to grow:
- Avoid overly specific scenario names
- Keep workstreams broad enough to expand
- Consider where new scenarios might fit

## Mapping

### Map as You Go

Don't save all mapping for the end:
- Link documents to scenarios as you create them
- Review mappings when adding new knowledge
- Update mappings when scenarios change

### Use a Coverage Matrix

Track what's mapped where:

| Scenario | Primary SOP | Policies | Templates | Complete? |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Cancel Order | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Modify Order | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | No |
| Track Order | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |

### Link Conservatively

Only link documents that are directly relevant:
- Would someone handling this scenario actually reference this?
- Does this document provide essential information?
- Is this a primary source or just tangentially related?

## Writing Step Guides

### Use Templates

Create a template for consistency:

```markdown
# [Scenario Name]

## When to Use
[Brief description]

## Prerequisites
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

## Steps
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Decision point]

## If [Condition]
[Alternative path]

## Escalation
[When and to whom]

## Related
- [Link 1]
- [Link 2]
```

### Write for AI, Not Humans

AI needs different things than humans:

| Human-Friendly | AI-Friendly |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Use common sense" | Explicit decision criteria |
| "As usual" | Specific step-by-step |
| Implied context | Stated prerequisites |
| Flexible language | Precise instructions |

### Include Decision Trees

For complex scenarios, make decisions explicit:

```
IF order has not shipped:
  → Process immediate cancellation
  → Initiate full refund

IF order has shipped but not delivered:
  → Cannot cancel
  → Offer return once delivered
  → Provide tracking info

IF order is delivered:
  → Redirect to return process
```

### Test Your Guides

Before considering a guide complete:
1. Walk through it yourself step by step
2. Have someone unfamiliar test it
3. Run it through the AI agent
4. Note any confusion or failures
5. Refine and repeat

## Team Collaboration

### Assign Ownership

For each area:
- Who is responsible for maintaining it?
- Who reviews changes?
- Who approves new content?

### Establish Review Processes

Before publishing changes:
- SME review for accuracy
- Peer review for clarity
- Test for AI effectiveness

### Document Your Decisions

Keep notes on why things are structured as they are:
- "Split this into two scenarios because the refund process differs"
- "Combined these because the procedure is identical"
- "Named this way to match the client's terminology"

## Maintenance

### Schedule Regular Reviews

Set a cadence:
- Weekly: Check for urgent updates
- Monthly: Review high-volume scenarios
- Quarterly: Full audit of hierarchy

### Track What Changes

When something changes:
1. Update the Step Guide
2. Create a new version with clear comment
3. Notify relevant team members
4. Test the updated guide

### Watch for Signals

Signs that content needs updating:
- AI giving outdated information
- Customer complaints about incorrect guidance
- Policy changes announced
- New systems or tools deployed

## Scaling Tips

### Parallelize Work

Multiple people can work simultaneously:
- Different workstreams assigned to different people
- SMEs write guides in their area
- Central team reviews for consistency

### Batch Similar Tasks

Group similar work together:
- Write all guides for one contact driver at once
- Map all documents of one type together
- Review all scenarios in one workstream together

### Automate What You Can

Look for opportunities:
- Template generation
- Consistency checking
- Coverage reporting
- Version tracking
