# Core Principles

These principles form the foundation of effective context engineering. Understanding them will help you make better decisions throughout the process.

## Principle 1: Separation of Raw and Ready

**Raw knowledge is not AI-ready knowledge.**

This is the most fundamental principle. The documents, PDFs, and notes you collect are *inputs* to the process, not the final product.

```
Raw Materials (Knowledge)     →     AI-Ready Content (Step Guides)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Training manuals              →     Structured procedures
Policy documents              →     Clear decision trees
Email templates               →     Contextual responses
Tribal knowledge              →     Documented processes
```

**Why this matters:**
- Raw documents often contain contradictions, outdated info, or incomplete coverage
- AI needs clear, unambiguous instructions to perform reliably
- The transformation process forces you to clarify and validate procedures

## Principle 2: Structure Enables Scale

**Good structure is what separates a pilot project from a production system.**

The hierarchy (Workstreams → Contact Drivers → Scenarios) isn't just organization—it's infrastructure.

### Without Structure

```
❌ Flat List of Guides:
- Handle customer questions
- Process returns
- Fix login issues
- Help with orders
- Deal with complaints
...and 200 more undifferentiated guides
```

### With Structure

```
✅ Organized Hierarchy:
Customer Support
├── Orders
│   ├── Cancel Order
│   ├── Modify Order
│   └── Track Order
├── Returns
│   ├── Start Return
│   └── Check Status
└── Account
    ├── Reset Password
    └── Update Info
```

**Why this matters:**
- AI can navigate to the right guide quickly
- Teams can work on different areas independently
- Gaps and overlaps become visible
- Maintenance stays manageable at scale

## Principle 3: One Scenario, One Guide

**Every scenario gets exactly one Step Guide. No more, no less.**

This 1:1 relationship seems restrictive but creates clarity:

| Violation | Problem | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0 guides for 1 scenario | AI has no guidance | Write the guide |
| 2+ guides for 1 scenario | AI doesn't know which to use | Merge or split |
| 1 guide for 2+ scenarios | Guide becomes confusing | Split scenarios |

**Why this matters:**
- Eliminates ambiguity about which guide applies
- Makes maintenance straightforward
- Ensures consistent AI behavior

## Principle 4: Completeness Over Perfection

**It's better to have rough content everywhere than perfect content somewhere.**

During knowledge gathering and hierarchy design, prioritize coverage:

```
Phase 1: Get everything
├── Upload all documents (even imperfect ones)
├── Define all scenarios (even rough ones)
└── Map all connections (even approximate ones)

Phase 2: Refine
├── Improve document quality
├── Refine scenario definitions
└── Verify mappings
```

**Why this matters:**
- Gaps in coverage mean AI can't help in those situations
- Perfect guides for 20% of scenarios leave 80% unhandled
- It's easier to improve existing content than create from nothing

## Principle 5: Process, Not Project

**Context engineering is ongoing maintenance, not a one-time effort.**

Think of it like a garden, not a construction project:

| Construction Mindset | Garden Mindset |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Build it once, done | Continuous care required |
| Perfection at launch | Iteration over time |
| Fixed scope | Evolving needs |
| Team disbands | Team maintains |

**Why this matters:**
- Processes change, policies update, edge cases emerge
- Regular maintenance keeps AI responses accurate
- Version history captures evolution over time

## Principle 6: User-Centric Organization

**Organize by what users need, not how your systems work.**

The hierarchy should reflect user goals, not internal structure:

```
❌ System-Centric:
- Salesforce Issues
- Shopify Issues
- Payment Gateway Issues

✅ User-Centric:
- Place an Order
- Track My Order
- Return an Item
```

**Why this matters:**
- Users don't know (or care) about your systems
- AI should match how users describe their needs
- Makes the hierarchy intuitive for everyone

## Principle 7: Explicit Over Implicit

**Say what you mean. AI can't read between the lines.**

In Step Guides, be explicit about everything:

```
❌ Implicit:
"Process the return as usual."

✅ Explicit:
"1. Open the order in Shopify
 2. Click More Actions → Create Return
 3. Select items to return
 4. Generate shipping label
 5. Email label to customer"
```

**Why this matters:**
- AI follows instructions literally
- "As usual" means nothing without context
- Explicit guides produce consistent results

## Principle 8: Test With Real Scenarios

**The best way to find gaps is to use what you built.**

Once you have Step Guides, test them:
- Walk through scenarios manually
- Use the AI agent on real inquiries
- Note where it struggles or fails

```
Testing Loop:
1. Run scenario through AI
2. Identify failure or weakness
3. Update Step Guide
4. Re-test
5. Repeat
```

**Why this matters:**
- Theoretical coverage ≠ practical effectiveness
- Real scenarios reveal edge cases
- Continuous improvement requires feedback

## Applying the Principles

As you work through context engineering, use these principles as a checklist:

<Accordion title="Principles Checklist">
- [ ] Am I separating raw materials from AI-ready content?
- [ ] Is my structure clear and scalable?
- [ ] Does each scenario have exactly one guide?
- [ ] Have I prioritized completeness over perfection?
- [ ] Am I treating this as ongoing work, not a one-time project?
- [ ] Is the organization user-centric?
- [ ] Are my guides explicit, not implicit?
- [ ] Am I testing with real scenarios?
</Accordion>
