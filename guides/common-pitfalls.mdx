# Common Pitfalls

These are the most frequent mistakes made in context engineering. Recognizing them helps you avoid or recover from them.

## Knowledge Gathering Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Treating Knowledge as Final

**The mistake**: Uploading documents and thinking the job is done.

**Why it happens**: It feels productive to collect lots of documents.

**The fix**: Remember that knowledge is raw material. The real work—writing Step Guides—comes later.

---

### Pitfall: Skipping Tribal Knowledge

**The mistake**: Only collecting written documents.

**Why it happens**: Documents are easy to gather; interviews take effort.

**The fix**: Schedule sessions with SMEs. Ask: "What do you do that isn't written down?"

---

### Pitfall: Collecting Without Organizing

**The mistake**: Dumping all documents into one folder without tags or categories.

**Why it happens**: Organization feels like it slows down collection.

**The fix**: Tag and categorize as you upload. The investment pays off immediately.

## Hierarchy Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Too Many Levels

**The mistake**: Creating 5+ levels of hierarchy.

**Why it happens**: Desire for perfect organization.

**The fix**: Stick to three levels (Workstream → Contact Driver → Scenario). If you need more granularity, it belongs in the Step Guide.

---

### Pitfall: System-Centric Organization

**The mistake**: Organizing by internal systems instead of user needs.

```
❌ Wrong:
- Salesforce Issues
- Shopify Issues

✅ Right:
- Order Problems
- Account Issues
```

**Why it happens**: Teams think in terms of their tools.

**The fix**: Ask: "What is the customer trying to accomplish?"

---

### Pitfall: Overlapping Scenarios

**The mistake**: Creating scenarios that aren't mutually exclusive.

```
❌ Overlapping:
- Cancel Order
- Refund Request
(What if someone wants to cancel for a refund?)
```

**Why it happens**: Different people create scenarios independently.

**The fix**: Define clear boundaries. Document what each scenario includes and excludes.

## Mapping Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Over-Mapping

**The mistake**: Linking every remotely related document to every scenario.

**Why it happens**: Fear of missing something.

**The fix**: Ask: "Would I actually reference this document when handling this specific scenario?"

---

### Pitfall: No Mapping at All

**The mistake**: Skipping the mapping phase entirely.

**Why it happens**: It seems like extra work with no immediate payoff.

**The fix**: Understand that mapping is your reference guide for writing Step Guides. It also enables future AI assistance.

## Step Guide Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Writing for Humans

**The mistake**: Using informal language, implied context, and "use your judgment."

```
❌ Human-style:
"Handle this the usual way, being mindful of the customer's feelings."

✅ AI-style:
"1. Acknowledge the issue
 2. Apologize for the inconvenience
 3. State the resolution
 4. Ask if there's anything else"
```

**Why it happens**: We write how we'd explain to a colleague.

**The fix**: Imagine explaining to someone who knows nothing about your company.

---

### Pitfall: Missing Edge Cases

**The mistake**: Only documenting the happy path.

**Why it happens**: Edge cases are easy to forget until they happen.

**The fix**: For each guide, ask: "What could go wrong? What exceptions exist?"

---

### Pitfall: One Guide for Multiple Scenarios

**The mistake**: Writing a single guide that tries to cover several scenarios.

```
❌ Too broad:
"Order Modifications Guide" covering cancels, address changes, and item changes

✅ Focused:
- "Cancel Order" guide
- "Change Shipping Address" guide
- "Modify Order Items" guide
```

**Why it happens**: Desire for efficiency.

**The fix**: Accept that one guide per scenario creates clearer, more maintainable content.

## Process Pitfalls

### Pitfall: Big Bang Approach

**The mistake**: Trying to complete all context engineering before using any of it.

**Why it happens**: Perfectionism; wanting everything ready.

**The fix**: Start with high-volume scenarios. Get some guides working, then expand.

---

### Pitfall: No Maintenance Plan

**The mistake**: Treating context engineering as a one-time project.

**Why it happens**: Projects have end dates; maintenance doesn't.

**The fix**: Assign ownership, schedule reviews, plan for updates.

---

### Pitfall: Solo Work

**The mistake**: One person doing everything alone.

**Why it happens**: Coordination overhead; feeling it's faster alone.

**The fix**: Involve SMEs for accuracy, peers for review, and leadership for prioritization.

## Recovery Strategies

Already made these mistakes? Here's how to recover:

### If You Have Unorganized Knowledge

1. Don't panic—the content is there
2. Create a categorization scheme
3. Process documents in batches
4. Tag as you go

### If Your Hierarchy Is Wrong

1. Identify the problem areas
2. Design the improved structure
3. Migrate scenarios gradually
4. Update as needed

### If Your Guides Are Poor Quality

1. Prioritize by usage (fix high-volume first)
2. Create a template for consistency
3. Rewrite one at a time
4. Test each rewritten guide

### If You Have No Maintenance Process

1. Assign owners to each area
2. Schedule a recurring review
3. Create a change log
4. Start tracking signals for needed updates
