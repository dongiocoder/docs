# Guides

These guides cover the philosophy, principles, and best practices of context engineering. They'll help you understand not just *what* to do, but *why* and *how* to do it well.

## What You'll Learn

## Who These Guides Are For

These guides are designed for:

- **New team members** learning context engineering for the first time
- **Experienced practitioners** looking to refine their approach
- **Team leads** establishing standards for their teams
- **Anyone** wanting to understand the "why" behind the process

## How to Use These Guides

### If You're New

Start with [Core Principles](/guides/core-principles) to understand the philosophy. Then read [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices) as you begin your first project.

### If You're Experienced

Skim [Common Pitfalls](/guides/common-pitfalls) to see if you recognize any patterns in your current work. Use [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices) as a checklist for your process.

### For Team Training

Use these guides as training materials. The principles and practices apply across any domain or use case.

## Key Takeaways

The most important concepts from these guides:

1. **Knowledge ≠ Step Guides**: Raw materials are inputs; Step Guides are outputs
2. **Structure enables scale**: Good hierarchy makes everything easier
3. **One guide per scenario**: The 1:1 relationship keeps things clear
4. **Completeness over perfection**: Get everything in, then refine
5. **Iterate continuously**: Context engineering is ongoing, not one-time
